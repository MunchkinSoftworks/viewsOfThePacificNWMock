// the resolution for a 2k Ultra wide monitor is 3440 x 1440
// the resolution for a 4k monitor is 3840 x 2160
// the resolution for a 1080p monitor is 1920 x 1080
// the approach i will take is the assumption of the website designed for a height and width of a 1080p mnitor, then proceed with the min-height and min-width paramenters which mean at least or greater the pixel specified. then a max width parameter to go smaller until phone size is reached. in the future I think a mobile first approach and then git bigger progresively with min-width and min-height is more logical and preferable.
